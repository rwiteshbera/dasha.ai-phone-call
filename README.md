1. Clone the repo and install the dependencies:

cd blank-slate-app
npm install
```

2. Create or log into your account using the Dasha CLI tool:

npx dasha account login
```

3. To start a text chat, run:

```sh
npm start chat
```

4. To receive a phone call from Dasha, run:

The phone number should be in the international format without the `+` (e.g. `12223334455`)
